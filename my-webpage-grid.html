                    When talking about Istanbul, we talking about a huge city in Turkey and it is rich in historic
                    places.
                    The city forms part of two continents making it simpler for intra-continent travelling with a ferry.
                    Both continents are divided by a Bosphorus Strait that joins the Black sea. The city itself is
                    considered to be the country's economic, cultural and historic capital. It holds great significant
                    history of Constantinople, Ottoman empire and religiouos places, for instance, Hagia Sophia.
                    The city is beautiful and people are just great. The transportation is affordable and
                    I got to experience beautiful sight-seeing. The reason I chose the city is because I went to
                    the city for my studies. And I want to visit the place for vacation to meet the great people I have
                    met.

                <h2>Swahili Language</h2>
                <p class="col-10">
                    In the world, there are multiple languages and it is basically based on an individual to
                    select their language of choice to learn for a particular reasoning of their own.
                    Learning a language is a good thing afterall because people enable themselves to
                    communicate with different people with different languages making it more easier to
                    survive in areas where one's home language or english may not be known by majority of the people.
                    Well, long story short, in this personal webpage I intended to tell the world about
                    the language of interest for me. The language is Swahili, the language is the most
                    spoken in Africa and as for someone who also want to travel around mother-continent.
                    I want to do it having Swahili language in the bag. As much as we can communicate with
                    each other in English, personally I would like to have a conversation with fellow brothers
                    of the continent in African language.
